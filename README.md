# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this study guide to help me during my bootcamp so that I have something to look back on and remind myself of the basic lessons I learned before starting the bootcamp. I'm hopeful that after some time in the bootcamp, I will no longer need this as I will have memorized and worked enough with these tools that I can then use this as a tool to look back on and remember where my coding journey started. As of right now, I've learned the very basics of a structured website and I hope with these notes, you can as well.

## Usage

Each section of this study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. The active JavaScript can be seen in the DevTools console, which can be opened with ctrl+shift+I on windows or command+option+I on mac and it lists out the different topics I learned and at random chooses one to study first.
